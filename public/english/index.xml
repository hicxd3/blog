      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nobdy seemed to care about Mary. She was born in India, where her father was a British official. He was busy with his work, and her nother, who was very beautiful, spent all her time going to parties. So an Indian woman, Kamala, was pid to take care of the little girl. Mary was not a pretty child, She had a thin angry face and thin yellow hair. She was always giving orders to Kamala, who had to obey. Mary never thought of other people, but only of herself. In fact, she was a very selfish, disagreeable, bad-tempered little girl.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re alike, you and me&amp;rdquo; old Ben Weatherstaff said to Mary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re not pretty to look at and we&amp;rsquo;re both very disagreeable.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Poor Mary! Nobody wants her, nobody likes her. Her parents have died, and she is sent home from Indies to live in her uncle&amp;rsquo;s house in Yorkshire. It is a big old house, with nearly a hundred rooms, but most of then ore shut and locked. Mary is cross and bored, and lonely. There is nothing to do all day, and no one to talk to, except old Ben Weatherstaff, the gardener.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

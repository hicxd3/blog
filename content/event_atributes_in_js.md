Event attributes are a way to attach event handlers directly to HTML elements. Using these attributes, you can respond to user actions like clicks, text input, or value changes.

Event attributes are HTML attributes used to assign event handlers to elements. Examples include `onclick`, `onmouseover`, `onkeyup`, and others.

Here’s a simple example of using an event attribute:

```js
<button onclick="alert('Button Pushed!')">Push me</button>
```

In this example, when the user clicks the button, the browser triggers the `click` event and calls the `alert()` function.

Event attributes in HTML do not require an external JavaScript file. 

The event and its handler are written directly in the HTML tag.

When the event occurs (like a button click), the code specified in the attribute is executed.

Main drawbacks of using event attributes:

- - Scalability issues: Adding multiple event handlers requires modifying HTML, making the code harder to manage.

- - Breaks separation of concerns: Event logic is embedded in HTML rather than separated into a JavaScript file, reducing maintainability.

- - Can’t attach multiple handlers: Only one handler can be assigned per event, which limits flexibility.

Using event attributes is fine for small projects or quick prototypes. However, for more complex applications, it’s better to use `addEventListener()` for more flexible event handling.

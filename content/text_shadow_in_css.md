If you want your text to stand out, adding a shadow can help.

In CSS, we use text-shadow to give text a subtle glow or dramatic depth.

```css
h1 {
  text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}
```

This adds a shadow 2px right and down, with a 4px blur and soft black color.

Key Points ^-^

- text-shadow: offset-x offset-y blur color

- No spread like box-shadow

- You can layer multiple shadows by comma

- Great for glow, depth, or mood

- Works best on large text like titles

## Let your letters breathe with letter-spacing

Sometimes, text feels too tight. To add elegance and clarity, use:

```css
letter-spacing: 0.05em;
```

It adds space between characters, making text lighter and more readable.

Key Points ^-^

- px, em, % — all supported

- em is scalable — perfect for responsive design

Combine with line-height for that perfect cozy layout

Great typography is invisible, but it makes everything feel right.

Arrow functions are a concise syntax for writing functions in JavaScript, introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015). They make writing functions cleaner and have some behavioral differences compared to traditional functions.

### Basic Syntax

```js
const func = (parameters) => {
  // function body
};
```

If the function has only one expression, you can omit the curly braces `{}` and the `return` keyword:

```js
const func = (parameters) => expression;
```

If there's only one parameter, you can omit the parentheses `()`:

```js
const func = parameter => expression;
```

If there are no parameters, parentheses are required:

```js
const func = () => expression;
```

### Examples

Traditional function:

```js
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

Arrow function:

```js
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
```

Function with no parameters:

```js
const greet = () => "Elle, I miss you!";
```

### Differences from Regular Functions

Arrow functions behave differently in a few key areas, especially when it comes to the `this` keyword.

1. **No own `this`**: Arrow functions do not have their own `this`. They inherit it from the surrounding context (lexical scope).
2. **No `arguments` object**: They don’t have the `arguments` object. If you need it, use a traditional function or rest parameters.
3. **Cannot be used as constructors**: You can't use them with `new`, as they aren’t meant to be constructor functions.
4. **No `super` or `new.target`**: They don’t bind `super` or `new.target`.

Arrow functions are best used for short functions and callbacks, especially when you need to preserve the `this` context.

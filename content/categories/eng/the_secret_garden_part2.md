Nobdy seemed to care about Mary. She was born in India, where her father was a British official. He was busy with his work, and her nother, who was very beautiful, spent all her time going to parties. So an Indian woman, Kamala, was pid to take care of the little girl. Mary was not a pretty child, She had a thin angry face and thin yellow hair. She was always giving orders to Kamala, who had to obey. Mary never thought of other people, but only of herself. In fact, she was a very selfish, disagreeable, bad-tempered little girl.

One very hot morning, when she was about nine years old, she woke up and saw that instead of Kamala there was a different Indian sevant by her bed.

"Mary saw that there was a different Indian sevant by her bed."

## Text-indent in CSS

The `text-indent` property sets the indentation of the first line in a block of text.

```css
text-indent: 2em;
```

This shifts the first line to the right by the specified amount.

Key Points ^-^

- Common units: px, em

- em adapts to font size, making it scalable

- Often used in long-form content for clean paragraph starts

- Can be negative to pull the first line left

A small touch that adds classic flow to your layout.
